# TinderForRecipes
At some point of time , all of us , are often spoilt for choice of what to eat and without a finite amount of choices, itâ€™s hard for us to make decisions. To solve this I have made an application named  Tinder for recipes . This app aims to give each user 5 to 10 recipe recommendations to choose from many cuisines . The premise is that the user could conclude at a decision of what to eat.
